1. **Exchanges**: Multiple exchanges providing raw price data.

2. **Edge Protocol**: Decentralized nodes collecting and validating data, with a leader node coordinating consensus.

3. **API Layer**: REST API endpoint and WebSocket for data distribution.

4. **Blockchain**: Smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains or Solana consuming the oracle data.

5. **Client Applications**: DApps and TradingView integrations utilizing the oracle data.

The flow shows how data is collected from various sources, processed by the oracle network, and then made available to client applications and on-chain smart contracts through the API layer.

This architecture ensures decentralization, reliability, and real-time data provision for DeFi applications while allowing for easy integration and on-chain verification.
