title: "Price Schema"
---

The Chaos Labs Edge Oracle API returns data in a consistent JSON format. Understanding this schema is essential for adequately integrating the oracle data into your dApp. Below is the schema for the price data returned from the available endpoints:

| **Field**  | **Type** | **Description**                                                                       |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| feedId     | string   | The identifier for the price feed (e.g., "ETHUSD")                                    |
| price      | integer  | The price value, represented as an integer                                            |
| ts         | integer  | Timestamp of the price update in Unix milliseconds                                    |
| expo       | integer  | Exponent for the price value. The actual price is calculated as `price * (10 ^ expo)` |
| signature  | string   | Cryptographic signature for verifying the authenticity of the data                    |
| recoveryId | integer  | An additional component of the signature used for verification                        |

Example Response:

```json
{
  "feedId": "ETHUSD",
  "price": 200000000000,
  "ts": 1653509453000,
  "expo": -8,
  "signature": "0x1234...5678",
  "recoveryId": 1
}
```

In this example, the actual ETH price would be 2000.00 USD (200000000000 \* 10^-8).
