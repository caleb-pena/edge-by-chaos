The **Edge Push Oracle** enables smart contracts to access reliable and decentralized price data using an efficient push-based mechanism. With support for multi-signature verification and an upgradable architecture, this oracle adheres to industry-standard interfaces, making it easy for projects to integrate and access data securely.

This guide explains how to use the Edge Push Oracle to fetch pricing data and incorporate it into your smart contract.

***

#### Key Features

* **Trusted Multi-Signature Verification**: Ensures data integrity by requiring majority approval from trusted oracle nodes.

* **Upgradable Architecture**: Built using the UUPS proxy pattern for seamless updates.

* **Familiar Interface**: Implements standard oracle functions like `latestAnswer` and `getRoundData`, compatible with widely used oracle solutions.

***

#### How to Use the Oracle

**1. Set Up Your Environment**

* Import the Edge Push Oracle contract ABI.

* Identify the deployed contract address for your desired network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, testnets).

Example:

```java
eEdgePushOracle oracle = EdgePushOracle(ORACLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS);
```

**2. Fetch the Latest Price**

Use the `latestAnswer()` function to obtain the most recent price. The result will be an integer representing the price, formatted with the specified number of decimals.

```java
int256 latestPrice = oracle.latestAnswer();
```

**3. Access Historical Data**

Retrieve historical price data for specific rounds using the `getRoundData` function. Each round provides a comprehensive dataset, including the price, timestamp, and block number.

```
(int256 price, uint256 reportRoundId, uint256 timestamp, uint256 blockNumber) = oracle.getRoundData(ROUND_ID);
```

**4. Monitor Updates in Real-Time**

Subscribe to the `NewPriceUpdate` event to react to new price reports. This is particularly useful for applications requiring immediate responses to market changes.

Event Example:

```csharp
event NewPriceUpdate(uint80 indexed roundId, int256 price, uint256 reportRoundId, uint256 timestamp, address transmitter, uint256 numSignatures);
```

#### Example Contract Integration

Hereâ€™s a basic example demonstrating how to integrate the Chaos Labs Edge Push Oracle into your smart contract:

```java
pragma solidity ^0.8.25;

interface IEdgePushOracle {
    function latestRoundData()
        external
        view
        returns (
            uint80 roundId,
            int256 answer,
            uint256 startedAt,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        );
    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
    function description() external view returns (string memory);
}

contract OracleConsumer {
    IEdgePushOracle public oracle;

    constructor(address oracleAddress) {
        oracle = IEdgePushOracle(oracleAddress);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Fetch the latest price data and metadata from the oracle.
     * @return roundId The round ID of the latest price update.
     * @return answer The latest price reported by the oracle.
     * @return updatedAt The timestamp when the latest price was updated.
     */
    function getLatestPriceData()
        external
        view
        returns (
            uint80 roundId,
            int256 answer,
            uint256 updatedAt
        )
    {
        (roundId, answer, , updatedAt, ) = oracle.latestRoundData();
        return (roundId, answer, updatedAt);
    }
}
```

***

#### Important Considerations

**Decimals Handling**

The `latestAnswer()` and `getRoundData()` functions return prices as integers. Use the `decimals` property of the oracle to format the values for display or further calculations.

**Timestamp Validation**

If precise timing is crucial, use the `getRoundData()` function to validate the timestamp of the data retrieved.

**Real-Time Updates**

Utilize the `NewPriceUpdate` event to build reactive systems that trigger actions based on price changes.
