title: "Node Operators"
---

Node operators play a critical role in the Edge Protocol by maintaining the decentralized infrastructure that powers the network. These operators run the nodes that perform crucial tasks such as validating transactions, securing the network, and ensuring the integrity of the data used across the protocol. By participating in this distributed system, node operators help to enhance the protocolâ€™s security, reliability, and transparency, making it a robust foundation for DeFi applications and services.

In the Edge Protocol, node operators are carefully selected and incentivized to ensure high-performance, low-latency data processing, essential for real-time price feeds, risk oracles, and other services. Their participation not only enables a decentralized infrastructure but also provides greater resilience to the protocol, minimizing the risk of data manipulation and other malicious activities.

Below is a list of the current node operators being onboarded to the Edge Protocol network, further contributing to the decentralization of the network:

* Blockdaemon

* Nethermind

* Matrixed.Link

**Note:** Decentralizing the Edge Protocol network is an ongoing effort. As the protocol evolves, more node operators will be added to further enhance the security, efficiency, and reliability of the network. This continuous expansion aims to bolster the decentralized nature of the protocol, ensuring greater resilience and scalability.
